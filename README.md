# GFG-Competition
GFG fuel consumption prediction regression model
<h3>Q.] What is your project about?</h3>
<p><em>> This project is about predict target variable MGP (Miles per Gallon) by using the features given in the dataset of the Competition Edu Dataset.</em></p>

<h3>Analysing the dataset</h3>
<p><em>While working with the dataset, the following conclusions were made:
<ul>
    <li>There are missing calues only in the 'Horsepower' column in the form of '?'</li>
    <li>Volkswagen (vw) makes cars with most miles/gallon</li>
    <li>MPG is most related to DIsplacement</li>
    <li>Car made earlier have less MPG</li>
    <li>Car with Origin 3 have most MPG</li>
</ul>
</p></em>
